      <h3>Germany: A Journey Through History, Landscapes, and Unexpected Weather</h3>
      <p>Germany is a country rich in history, breathtaking landscapes, and remarkable architecture—though the food didn’t quite meet our expectations. Typically, my wife and I travel alone, but this time, we were joined by my two sisters-in-law and brother-in-law. After landing in Munich, we picked up our rental car and embarked on an 18-day adventure. Below is a condensed itinerary highlighting key moments.</p>

    <h3>Day 1: Füssen and Neuschwanstein Castle</h3>
    <p>Our first stop was Hotel Hirsch in Füssen, an ideal base for visiting Neuschwanstein Castle the following day. The castle is located near the village of Hohenschwangau (<em>less than 2 miles away</em>), which is also home to Hohenschwangau Castle—the childhood residence of King Ludwig II, who later commissioned Neuschwanstein. While Füssen is the closest town, Hohenschwangau serves as the main gateway to the castles, offering shops, hotels, and tourist amenities.</p>
    <p>Arriving early, we caught the first shuttle bus to the castle. Determined to beat the crowds, I rushed to <strong>Marienbrücke (Mary’s Bridge)</strong> for an unobstructed view. This bridge offers a stunning vantage point of Neuschwanstein and its surroundings. We even hiked up a trail beyond the bridge, which rewarded us with another breathtaking perspective.</p>

  <br>
    <p>After the castle visit, we drove to Grainau, checked into our hotel, and took a short rest before heading to <strong>Partnachklamm Gorge</strong>. Carved over millions of years by the Partnach River, this natural wonder became accessible in 1912 when guide Josef Naus built a trail through its dramatic cliffs and waterfalls. The roaring water and sheer power of the gorge were mesmerizing.</p>

  <h3>Day 2: Zugspitze and Lake Eibsee</h3>
    <p>After a hearty breakfast, we bid “Bis zum nächsten Mal!” to our host, Christian, and set off for Zugspitze—Germany’s highest peak at 2,962 meters (9,718 feet). Unfortunately, snowy, overcast weather dashed our hopes of panoramic views from the summit. Undeterred, we explored Lake Eibsee, located right next to the cable car parking lot. We enjoyed a peaceful walk along its outer paths, soaking in the serene beauty—until rain cut our stroll short. We laughed it off as an “authentic” German experience.  </p>
