          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Welcome to my page! I'm Mark, a travel enthusiast and explorer of cultures. I love sharing my experiences and connecting with others who share similar passions.</p> <p>The main purpose of this website is to teach myself web development and move away from my previous blogger site, which left me frustrated with its interface and unsatisfied with the results. I decided to put more effort into learning web development so I could enjoy the process and the end result.</p> <p>This site is still a work in progress, and I'll continue tweaking it as I go.</p> <p>If you’ve made it this far, thank you! I hope you’ve found something useful on this site, and I look forward to having you join me on this journey as it unfolds.</p>
